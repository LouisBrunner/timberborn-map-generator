# Timberborn Random Map Generator

This repository contains a tool that can be used to generate maps for the game [Timberborn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/).

**THIS TOOL IS CURRENTLY IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT**

## Concept

Using Perlin noise to generate a rough topology. Then some method (maybe another layer of noise?) to generate nature and other fixtures.

## Issues

- The current implementation tries to setup sources to make rivers but fails.
- The starting position is not placed correctly.
- No vegetation/ruins are generated.
